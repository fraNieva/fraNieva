## Hi there I'm Franco Nieva <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" height="auto" width="30">

### I'm a Web Developer with experience in Front End and some in Back End.

- I use daily: `.ts`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.sass`
- Passionate about developing better software solutions for people's lives and interested in knowing how software works.
- A proactive person that gets motivated when learning new technologies, languages, tools and taking on new challenges.
- I am self-taught in web and software development but my background in engineering helps me a lot in understanding logic, math, physics, algebra and to have a problem solving mindset.
